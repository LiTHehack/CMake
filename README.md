#CMake

This is an example project in C++ to show how a project can be structured using CMake as a build-system. Read more about CMake at http://www.cmake.org/.

##Create project
It is highly recommended to keep the CMake project files (generated by CMake) in a sub folder to the top level directory. This is because it makes it easier to distinguish between source and generated files and binaries. One way is to create a folder called "build" which is used in the following sections.
###Command-line

Changing directory to the build directory and runs CMake with the relative path to the top-level CMakeLists.txt file. Then builds the project using the system "make" command which uses the generated "Makefile".
	
	$ cd build/
	$ cmake ../ 
	$ make

Execute the binary from the current directory

	$ ../bin/Hello

It is also possible to generate Xcode (and many other project types), see "man cmake" for complete list.
	
	$ cmake ../ -G Xcode

###GUI
- Run the GUI and set the "Where is the source code" to the top-level directory. 
- Create "build" directory
- Set the "Where to build the binaries" to the build folder
- Run configure and choose the type of project (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc)
- Run generate to create project files. 
- Open the project files and build the binaries

#Feedback
Feel free to submit feedback, issues and feature requests. This is only a very simple example project which can be changed and expanded in many ways.
